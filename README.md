# Hello ( ¬¥ œâ ` )„ÉéÔæû
Welcome to my GitHub page, this is the showcase of my work. Among my projects, there are tools, documents, and creative expression. All of these are planned, designed, developed, and maintained by myself. 

## Engines
These projects are meant to be the ones that make programs of their own. Builders, compilers, languages, or simulators. 

| üêú [Myrmex](https://github.com/CarcajadaArtificial/Myrmex) | üè¥ [ana.js](https://github.com/CarcajadaArtificial/ana.js) |
|---|---|
| Ecosystem Evolution Simulator. | A JavaScript library for the cool kids. |
| ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/rust-%23000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white) | ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) |

## Front-End Libraries
These libraries are not necessarily meant for the web, in the future, I'm planning on making a small front-end library for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and [Egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). Also, front-end libraries may contain certain outside utilities that aid in the interface's construction.

| üß± [Ana Components](https://github.com/CarcajadaArtificial/ana-components) | üìê [Ana Utils](https://github.com/CarcajadaArtificial/ana-utils) |
|---|---|
| UI library for Ana. | Utility functions for Ana. |
| ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)![SASS](https://img.shields.io/badge/SASS-hotpink.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=SASS&logoColor=white) | ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) |

## Websites
These are the projects that are meant to be used as a website. At the time of writing this, I don't plan on using anything outside [Deno](https://deno.land) and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev). With each day that passes, I use fewer and fewer Node.js for my personal projects.
